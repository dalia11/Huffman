1. Mer Sort
The merge sort algorithm closely follows the divide-andconquer
paradigm. Intuitively,
it operates as follows.
Divide: Divide the n-element sequence to be sorted into
two subsl osgpen oon  2 elements each.
Conquer: Sort the two subsequences reytvoely using
merge sort.
Combine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to product
the sorted answer.
Merge Sort
A sorting algorithm based on divide and conquer.
Because we are dealinwith sub problems we state the
sub problem as sorting a subarray A[p…r]. Initily p=1 and
r=n but this values chai as we recurse through sub
problems to sort A[p…r]
